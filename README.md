Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, has always been subject to cycles of hype, fear, and volatility. With its price movements often correlating with public interest, analyzing the connection between Bitcoin's price and Google search trends provides valuable insights.
Understanding BitcoinÂ Cycles
From my own experience trading Bitcoin, there are a total of 4 main phases:
1.Accumulation Phase: Low public interest and price stagnation.
2.Bull Phase: Explosive growth in price driven by high demand.
3.Distribution Phase: A plateau where early investors sell off holdings.
4.Bear Phase: Decline in price and reduced media attention.
